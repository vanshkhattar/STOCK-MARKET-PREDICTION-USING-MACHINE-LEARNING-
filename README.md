# Stock Market Prediction Models

This project includes three machine learning models to predict stock prices using:
1. Random Forest Regression
2. Support Vector Regression (SVM)
3. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## Dataset
Place your stock history CSV file in the `data/` folder with the filename:
```
TCS_stock_history.csv
```

## Usage
Run each script independently:
```bash
python model1_random_forest.py
python model2_svm.py
python model3_ann.py
```

## Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- keras
- tensorflow
